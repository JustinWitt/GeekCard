An Android program to create unique contact cards that can be passed with near field communication.

I thought there might be a need for an app that would allow someone to pass contact information to another person in a way that controlled how the other person viewed the information.

It was never quite completed, I'm going to go back someday and finish it, just because I still think it is a good idea.
